Ruben Stefanus is Data Scientist at [Halodoc](https://www.halodoc.com/) and Co-Founder of [Jakarta Artificial Intelligence Research](https://linktr.ee/jakartaresearch).

First and foremost, I love data and technology. 
The thought of how data and technology could solve real problems and improve our lives really amazed me ✨

Therefore, I majored in Electrical Engineering ⚡️ with a Computer Engineering 💻 minor, which is at the heart of many modern technologies today

All of that led me to go deep into the fields of Data Science

- 🔥 I'm deeply passionate about creating impact and solve the real problems
- ☕️ I also like to meet people over coffee
- ✨ Bringing research and innovation into the real world

Outside of work, Ruben enjoys reading book, listening to podcasts, workout in gym, teaching and mentoring people.

    "text": "2 Introduction\nAs part of this blog post we will be uncovering the inner workings of CLIP - Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision (Radford et al. (2021)), and we will be looking at it’s PyTorch implementation in part-2 of the blog that will be released next week.\n\nRadford, Alec, Jong Wook Kim, Chris Hallacy, Aditya Ramesh, Gabriel Goh, Sandhini Agarwal, Girish Sastry, et al. 2021. “Learning Transferable Visual Models from Natural Language Supervision.” CoRR abs/2103.00020. https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020.\nCLIP in itself does not present a new idea, but implements an older idea of learning Image representations from text. CLIP applies this idea to a large scale dataset (400M images), and achieves zero shot transfer on ImageNet that matches ResNet-50. At the time of writing CLIP was the first model architecture to achieve such great zero shot results on ImageNet.\n\n2.1 Key Contributions\nIf I am to summarise key contributions from the paper:\n\nNew (image, text) pair dataset: We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet.\nZero-shot performance that is competitive with supervised models: We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training.\nHigh zero shot performance on ImageNet: We match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on.\nOpen source model and weights: We release our code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/OpenAI/CLIP.\n\nBefore we start looking at the inner workings of CLIP, let’s look at some background that led to the development of CLIP."

    "section": "3 Motivation for CLIP & Prior Work",
    "text": "3 Motivation for CLIP & Prior Work\nCLIP was written in 2021, at a time where text transformer based models like GPT-3 (and others) were competitive across many tasks on various benchmark datasets, swhile requiring little to no dataset specific training data. This was made possible by pretraining on huge amounts of data found directly from the web. Pre-training on Wikipidea articles (WebText which contained the text subset of these 45 million links), became standard practice.\nIt was clear that models pre-trained on high web-scale collections of text surpassed that of high-quality crowd-labeled NLP datasets.\nBut, for vision based models, it was still standard practice to pre-train models on crowd-labeled datasets such as ImageNet. The question then is Could scalable pre-training methods which learn directly from web text result in a similar breakthrough in computer vision?\nAt the time it was still common practice to train on crowd labeled datasets for computer vision.\nFor example, Kolesnikov et al. (2019) and Dosovitskiy et al. (2020) had demonstrated large gains on a broader set of transfer benchmarks by pre-training models to predict the classes of the noisily labeled JFT-300M dataset. But both approaches used static softmax classifiers to perform prediction, which severely curtails their flexibility and limits their “zero-shot” capabilities.\nBut also, before CLIP some attempts had been made to learn image representations directly from text - VirTex (Desai & Johnson, 2020), ICMLM (Bulent Sariyildiz et al., 2020), and ConVIRT (Zhang et al., 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn my humble opinion, ConVirt - “Contrastive Learning of Medical Visual Representations from Paired Images and Text” (Zhang et al., 2020) is of most interest of all prior work.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Two example chest X-ray images with different abnormality categories\n\n\nConVirt introduced a new method of pretraining medical image encoders with the paired text data (as in Figure 1) via a bidirectional contrastive objective between the two modalities. This method was domain-agnostic, and required no additional expert input.\nHowever, ConVirt had been applied in the medical context. CLIP expanded this idea to general visual recognition. Thus, ConVirt directly inspired CLIP.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Overview of ConVirt\n\n\nThe figure above shows the overview of ConVirt, and as you’ll notice, CLIP is quite similar.\nFrom the ConVirt paper:\nConVIRT has directly inspired subsequent studies such as the CLIP framework (Radford et al., 2021) and the ALIGN model (Jia et al., 2021), which showed that direct adaptations of ConVIRT-style pretraining at much larger scales lead to state-of-the-art general visual recognition capabilities."

    "section": "4 Approach",
    "text": "4 Approach\nAt the core of our approach is the idea of learning perception from supervision contained in natural language. As discussed before, this is not at all a new idea.\nLearning from natural language has several potential strengths over other training methods. Can you think of some?\n\nIt’s much easier to scale natural language supervision compared to standard crowd-sourced labeling for image classification.\nLearning from natural language also has an important advantage over most unsupervised or self-supervised learning approaches in that it doesn’t “just” learn a representation but also connects that representation to language which enables flexible zero-shot transfer.\n\n\n4.1 Summary with Pseudo-Code\nIn this section I will present the summary of CLIP architecture from the paper.\nThe overall approach has been presented in Figure 3 below. Can you notice the similarities to ConVirt in Figure 2?\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Summary of CLIP approach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCLIP Is architecture agnostic. You can use any models as visual and text encoders in Figure 3.\nA team led by Ross Wightman, Cade Gordon, and Vaishaal Shankar have a repository OpenCLIP that is an open source implementation of CLIP and enables training for any vision models with contrastive image-text supervision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAlso, recently, Ross Wightman also announced a 847M param ConvNext model trained via CLIP training that achieves 79.43% ImageNet zero-shot eval. Astonishing, right?\n\n\nThe approach presented in Figure 3 has been summarised in pseudo code from paper:\n# image_encoder - ResNet or Vision Transformer \n# text_encoder - CBOW or Text Transformer \n# I[n, h, w, c] - minibatch of aligned images \n# T[n, l] - minibatch of aligned texts \n# W_i[d_i, d_e] - learned proj of image to embed \n# W_t[d_t, d_e] - learned proj of text to embed \n# t - learned temperature parameter \n\n# extract feature representations of each modality \nI_f = image_encoder(I) #[n, d_i] \nT_f = text_encoder(T) #[n, d_t] \n\n# joint multimodal embedding [n, d_e] \nI_e = l2_normalize(np.dot(I_f, W_i), axis=1) \nT_e = l2_normalize(np.dot(T_f, W_t), axis=1) \n\n# scaled pairwise cosine similarities [n, n] \nlogits = np.dot(I_e, T_e.T) * np.exp(t) \n\n# symmetric loss function \nlabels = np.arange(n) \nloss_i = cross_entropy_loss(logits, labels, axis=0) \nloss_t = cross_entropy_loss(logits, labels, axis=1) \nloss = (loss_i + loss_t)/2\nLet’s look at what it all means with the help of Microsoft Excel.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Illustration of contrastive loss\n\n\nLet’s say we have 8 images with corresponding text descriptions as in Figure 4. CLIP presents a training framework to maximise the cosine similarity of text and image embeddings.\nAs from the pseudo-code, first we pass the images through image encoder and texts through text encoder respective to get image and text features.\n\n# ! pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport clip\nimport timm\n\n\nx = torch.randn(8, 3, 224, 224)\nvisual_enc = timm.create_model('resnet50', num_classes=0)\nI_f = visual_enc(x)\nn, d_i = I_f.shape\nn, d_i\n\n(8, 2048)\n\n\nTherefore in the above case, referencing to pseuo-code, \\(n=8\\) and \\(d_i = 2048\\).\n\ntext_enc = nn.Embedding(100, 768)\nT_f = text_enc(torch.arange(8))\nn, d_t = T_f.shape\nn, d_t\n\n(8, 768)\n\n\nSimilarly, referencing to pseudo-code, \\(n=8\\) and \\(d_t=768\\).\nLet’s just assume the embedding dimension \\(d_e = 1024\\), now, as per psuedo-code, we can have two projection layers- \\(W_i[d_i, d_e]\\) and \\(W_t[d_t, d_e]\\) both for text and image features respectively.\n\nd_e = 1024\nW_i = nn.Linear(d_i, d_e)\nW_t = nn.Linear(d_t, d_e)\nW_i, W_t\n\n(Linear(in_features=2048, out_features=1024, bias=True),\n Linear(in_features=768, out_features=1024, bias=True))\n\n\nNow that we have our projection layers, as per pseudo-code, we get our joint multimodal embeddings through dot product.\n\nI_e = W_i(I_f)\nT_e = W_t(T_f)\nI_e.shape, T_e.shape\n\n(torch.Size([8, 1024]), torch.Size([8, 1024]))\n\n\nNow that we both our Image and Text embeddings, we can find cosine-similarity.\n\n# scaled pairwise cosine similarities [n, n] \nlogits = I_e @ T_e.T\nlogits.shape\n\ntorch.Size([8, 8])\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Cosine similarity between text and image features\n\n\nWe want the cosine similarity of real (text, image) pairs to be high (right diagonal), and everywhere else to be low.\nSo what loss function could we use in this case? The answer is in the pseudo-code.\n# symmetric loss function \nlabels = np.arange(n) \nloss_i = cross_entropy_loss(logits, labels, axis=0) \nloss_t = cross_entropy_loss(logits, labels, axis=1) \nloss = (loss_i + loss_t)/2\nWhen we do cross entropy loss with both axis=1 and axis=0, we are pushing logits to be high for the diagonal and low everywhere else. This is also referred to as Contrastive Loss. Thus, by doing this the CLIP model is able to learn visual features directly from text.\nBy training on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs, the CLIP model is able to attain zero shot performance on ImageNet that is comparable to ResNet-50!\nAnd that’s really all the magic behind CLIP."

## Career
### NVIDIA (February, 2019 - Now)
I currently work as a Senior Deep Learning Engineer at NVIDIA at Santa Clara, California. Here I am developing and engineering machine learning and deep learning algorithms for solving industrial and practical problems in natural language processing, computer vision, and speech processing. In addition, I am also developing solutions for deploying neural network model on data center GPUs and resource-constrained and safety-critical SoCs. Writing programs using C++, CMake, Python, and sometimes CUDA, is routine.

In 2020, I started to work on NVIDIA Autonomous Vehicles. I mainly focused on the optimization, quantization, pruning, architecture search, and inference, for self-driving perception neural networks.

## Education
### University of Chicago (September, 2017 - December, 2018)
I received a M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the University of Chicago. I did part-time research in Matthew Walter Lab at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, an independent research institution inside the University of Chicago campus, on vehicle localization problems using deep learning and Bayesian methods.

## Skills
### Programming Language
I often program using C/C++, CMake and Python. I also have experiences in programming using CUDA, Java, Scala, Haskell, MATLAB, JavaScript, and R and have done at least one large project for each of them.

### Machine Learning and Deep Learning
Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Speech Processing, Statistical Methods, Optimization Methods.
